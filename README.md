👨‍💻 A small summary of what I do and who I am:

Working since 2014 on Software, I've been through every job on the field, from a ticket-grabbing developer, through full-stack, infrastructure, database management, continuous delivery, frontend and backend engineering, and even information security.

I've managed teams of 1 to 15 people of various fields of expertise such as Design, Data Science, Quality Assurance and Engineering and I was quite lucky to work with some of the best in the business.

Working directly with business owners and clients is something I have years of experience in, therefore I understand the value of translating a vision into an actionable roadmap and its features.

Bringing you value is my passion, that's why I build stuff.
