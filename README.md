👨‍💻 A small summary of what I do and who I am:

With over 10 years of experience in the software industry, I’ve navigated through various roles since 2014. My journey has taken me from an entry-level developer to mastering full-stack engineering, infrastructure, database management, continuous delivery, frontend and backend engineering, and even information security.

I’ve had the privilege of managing teams of various sizes, from small groups to larger teams, across diverse fields such as Design, Data Science, Quality Assurance, and Engineering. Working alongside some of the best in the business has been a highlight of my career.

My extensive experience working directly with business owners and clients has honed my ability to translate visions into actionable roadmaps and features.

Bringing value through innovative solutions is my passion, and that’s why I build. 👨‍💻
